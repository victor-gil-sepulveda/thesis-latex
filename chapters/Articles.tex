In this chapter, we present the scientific production relevant to the three objectives we proposed previously. The three articles presented here include supporting materials that complement the reading. We have decided to add them here and to make some enhancements in order to improve their integration with the rest of the document. Some of the changes we have introduced are: correction of minor spelling and grammar errors, rework of figures (whenever possible), and addition of their references to the main bibliography. 

The author also proposed and directed three Computer Engineering Degree Projects, all of them for the Facultat d'Inform\`atica de Barcelona, Universitat Polit\`ecnica de Catalunya, which are also related to the objectives. 

\section{Technical improvement of PELE}
Due to the complexity of the project, which is in continuous evolution, no publication has yet been issued related to Objective 1.a and Objective 1.b. Despite this, as the software is nowadays reaching its maturity, we do not discard to release a publication concerning its new features and technical improvements in the near future. A benchmark using the new version of the code has been recently published \cite{grebner_binding_2016}.

\section{Algorithmic improvement of PELE}
We present the draft of an article regarding Objective 2.a, which will be submitted as soon as possible to a scientific journal. Again, we have included its supplementary materials.

\subsection{Role of the authors}
The author of this thesis was the main responsible for: developing the methods introduced in each publication, planning and running the analysis required for the evaluation of the methods, as well as writing the articles themselves. The collaborators were involved in the following processes: suggesting theoretical improvements, relating the analyses with the biological background of the systems, and adding contents to and proofreading the articles.
